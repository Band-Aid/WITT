Add a screenshot to Pendo tag pages/features

Tagged pages and features in VDS will capture a screenshot.

When naviagating to page and features details page a screenshot will be appended to the header.

Screenshots are saved in localstorage. Deleting the extension will flush all local storage.

Clicking on the extension Icon will show a list of captured tags.

Export / Import captured tags.

## Todo:

- [ ] Better handling of image data #5
  - [ ] use some sort of db to store data instead of localstorage
  - [ ] compress image

- [ ] Clean up code
  - [ ] it's all over the place

- [ ] Split tag data by Sub ID
  - [ ] Support Exporting tags but Sub ID
